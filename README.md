## 3D-simulation of movements along geodetic lines on the globe with JAVA

This project calculates and simulates the shortest route along the globe between two coordinates by drawing a curve from point A to B. 
For this simulation the globe is portrayed as a wireframe model with an outline ellipse for better visualisation.

To choose the starting location, you should add longitude and latitude(seperated by comma) to the 'Start' field.
Repeat for the 'End' field.
With the slider 'alpha', the angle between the E3- and E1-axis can be adjusted, meaning a change of perspective of the globe.
The 's1'slider scales the E1-axis and therfore adjusting the perspective of the globe as well(From circular to elliptical).
